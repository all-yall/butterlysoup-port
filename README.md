## What is this?
This is a port of the game [Butterfly Soup](https://brianna-lei.itch.io/butterfly-soup) 
using the framework [Portmaster](https://portmaster.games/). This does not include
any game files, but with them you should be able to play the game on some handheld devices
such as the RG35XXSP and other aarch64 architecture devices.

## How do I use it? 
Drop the entire contents of the `ButterflySoup-2.20-linux/game` folder
into the `gamefiles` folder and then run the `./Butterfly Soup.sh` script to start it.
